# BTD-15112
A short description of the project's name and what it does:
My project is called BTD 15112. My project takes a lot of influence from the 
game BTD 6. Within the game there are towers/monkeys that are defending against 
multiple waves of enemies/balloons. The goal is to not let any of the balloons
reach the end of the path as it will result in you losing health and ultimately
losing the game. There are four monkeys you can utlize each with a different
amount of damage they deal and also one has a different range they can attack
from. There are 9 different balloons within the game. Each of them have
different health and some of them move either faster or slower than others. 

How to run the project:
To run the project is rather simple. You would just press control b to begin
running the program and then it will take you to the starting screen. Within
the starting screen there is an instruction of how to begin the game.

A list of any shortcut commands that exist:
